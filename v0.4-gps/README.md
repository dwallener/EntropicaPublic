Can a drone/camera figure out where it is based on what it sees? Yes, it can. This topogrophy was pulled from the Burrard Inlet/Port Moody area. This is all built using low resolution training, due to compute limitations. In reality, the available optical capacity is MUCH higher than we are using.

Using position encoding (suitable for laser link comms):
